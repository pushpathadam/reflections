Notes on lesson 3

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Useful if you work from multiple locations or machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatically might be resource heavy with multiple remotes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clones are direct copy (remote called origin) with no shared origin.
    forks are a copy on github's repository which link back to an origin
    branches are a local copy which links back to shared history with its parent

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
