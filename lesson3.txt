Notes on lesson 3

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Useful if you work from multiple locations or machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatically might be resource heavy with multiple remotes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clones are direct copy (remote called origin) with no shared origin.
    forks are a copy on github's repository which link back to an origin
    branches are a local copy which links back to shared history with its parent

inside recipes
git init
  551  git remote add origin https://github.com/pushpathadam/recipes.git
  553  git pull https://github.com/pushpathadam/recipes.git
  555  atom espresso.txt
  556  git add espresso.txt
  557  git commit espresso.txt
  560  git push origin master

or
 git remote add origin https://github.com/pushpathadam/reflections.git
  496  git push -u origin master

Can't push back up from a clone vs a remote is fine.
